WHEN SUPERSTARS AND CANNONBALLS ARE RUNNING THROUGH YOUR HEAD
AND TELEVISION FREAK SHOW COPS AND ROBBERS EVERYWHERE
SUBWAY MAKES ME NERVOUS PEOPLE PUSHING ME TOO FAR
IVE GOT TO BREAK AWAY
SO TAKE MY HAND NOW
CAUSE I WANT TO LIVE LIKE ANIMALS
CARELESS AND FREE LIKE ANIMALS
I WANT TO LIVE
I WANT TO RUN THROUGH THE JUNGLE
WITH WIND IN MY HAIR AND THE SAND AT MY FEET
IVE BEEN HAVING DIFFICULTIES KEEPING TO MYSELF
FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS BETTER LEFT UP ON THE SHELF
ANIMALS AND CHILDREN TELL THE TRUTH THEY NEVER LIE
WHICH ONE IS MORE HUMAN
THERES A THOUGHT NOW YOU DECIDE
COMPASSION IN THE JUNGLE
COMPASSION IN YOUR HANDS YEAH
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE MY HAND YEAH
SOMETIMES THIS LIFE CAN GET YOU DOWN
ITS SO CONFUSING
THERES SO MANY RULES TO FOLLOW
AND I FEEL IT
CAUSE I JUST RUN AWAY IN MY MIND
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
SUPERSTARS AND CANNONBALLS RUNNING THROUGH YOUR HEAD
TELEVISION FREAK SHOW COPS AND ROBBERS EVERYWHERE
ANIMALS AND CHILDREN TELL THE TRUTH THEY NEVER LIE
WHICH ONE IS MORE HUMAN
THERES A THOUGHT NOW YOU DECIDE
COMPASSION IN THE JUNGLE
COMPASSION IN YOUR HANDS YEAH
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE MY HAND YEAH
