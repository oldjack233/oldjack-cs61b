macOS


2. Version of the Java system you are using (java -version).


11


3. Subdirectory of your Git working directory to use as the current
   directory when compiling and running your program.

Just the master branch


4. EXACT sequence of commands that will cause the error you are seeing,
   including anything needed to compile and execute the program.
   It is NOT acceptable to say "any execution of the program fails"; give
   us a specific one.

I pass all the test in ModelTests.java, but failed on extendSimpleTest1,extendSimpleTest2,
In puzzleGeneratorTests.java. 
The error occur when you run the above two test I mentioned.


5. What you see when you execute the commands in 4.

In console, I saw:

java.lang.AssertionError: Wrong at (0, 1) 
Expected :6
Actual   :0

I found the same error in piazza @335_f3, but I tried what he did to his problem but still I cannot pass. I believe it has to do with connect, connectable, auto connect and FindUniquepredecessor and FindUniqueSuccessor. I double check them all. They performs well when running their corresponding add-hoc test. So I really don't know how to fix it.
